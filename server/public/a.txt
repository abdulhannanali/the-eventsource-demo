                    Tracking the location, communicated with the help of oldy <code>EventSource</code> API,
                    available in Chrome and Firefox. This is the last goodbye from me to the EventSource
                    API which is not going to be made available in ServiceWorker and Edge people already 
                    demand it's deprecation. Let's make EventSource great again.
